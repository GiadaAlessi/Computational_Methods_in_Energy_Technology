# Exercise 03 - Numerical Solution for 1D Steady Heat Conduction in a Tube with Forced and Natural Convection

This project models the **one-dimensional steady-state heat conduction** in a cylindrical tube subjected to both **internal forced convection** and **external natural convection**. The solution is achieved using the **finite volume method** combined with the **Gauss-Seidel** and **TDMA** algorithms.

## üîç Project Overview
The project explores:
- Numerical solution of steady-state conduction using the **finite volume method**.
- Evaluation of internal forced convection and external natural convection effects.
- Iterative process using:
  - **Gauss-Seidel algorithm** for solving internal fluid properties.
  - **TDMA (Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm)** for solving the conduction problem in the tube thickness.
- Analysis of thermophysical properties for different fluids:
  - **Water**, **Therminol 66**, and **Air**.

## üüßüü¶ MATLAB Code
The MATLAB code implements:
- Discretization of the geometry using finite volumes.
- Iterative calculations to achieve convergence on velocity, pressure, and temperature profiles.
- Detailed evaluation of heat transfer coefficients and their effect on system performance.
